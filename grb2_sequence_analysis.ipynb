    "## Abstract:\n",
    "GRB2 (growth factor receptor–bound protein 2) is an adaptor protein that plays a central role in growth factor–mediated signal transduction by linking activated receptor tyrosine kinases to the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade. This pathway is essential for regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival and is frequently dysregulated in cancer. In this notebook, computational analyses are used to examine GRB2 protein sequences across vertebrate species and to assess sequence and structural features relevant to signaling function. By characterizing evolutionary conservation across GRB2, this work explores how sequence variation may influence downstream signaling behavior and contribute to disease-associated perturbations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How This Notebook Can Be Used:\n",
    "This notebook uses vertebrate sequence comparisons to establish a baseline map of functional constraint across the GRB2 protein. By quantifying conservation across the full-length sequence and key signaling domains, the analysis provides a framework for prioritizing cancer-associated GRB2 variants that occur in highly conserved regions and are therefore more likely to disrupt RTK–RAS/MAPK signaling. The same conservation-based scoring approach can be readily extended to additional signaling proteins or applied to independent mutation datasets."

For each species, the first FASTA record was extracted and stored as a string representing the amino acid sequence. The human GRB2 sequence was designated as the reference sequence for all subsequent comparative analyses."

    "GRB2 protein sequences were successfully compared across all vertebrate species included in the analysis, with full-length sequences recovered for each species.

This strong conservation suggests that GRB2 plays a fundamental role in cellular signaling that has been preserved throughout vertebrate evolution.\n",

    "When conservation was examined at the domain level, clear patterns emerged. The SH2 domain was especially well conserved across species, consistent with its role in binding phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases and initiating downstream signaling. The SH3 domains also displayed substantial conservation, supporting their importance in mediating protein–protein interactions that propagate signaling through pathways such as RAS/MAPK.\n",

    "While small differences in conservation were observed between domains, all major signaling interfaces remained highly preserved. Together, these findings indicate that the regions of GRB2 responsible for assembling and regulating signaling complexes are under strong evolutionary constraint. The consistency of conservation across species reinforces the idea that even modest alterations in these domains could have meaningful effects on signaling behavior."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "This analysis shows that GRB2 is highly conserved across vertebrate species, which aligns with its central role as an adaptor protein in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. The strong conservation observed at the whole-protein level suggests that GRB2 structure and function have been maintained over evolutionary time, emphasizing how essential this protein is for regulating pathways involved in cell growth, survival, and differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining individual domains adds important context. The SH2 domain was especially conserved across all species analyzed, consistent with its role in binding phosphorylated receptors and initiating downstream signaling through the RAS/MAPK pathway. The SH3 domains also remained highly conserved, supporting their role in mediating protein–protein interactions within signaling complexes. Greater divergence observed in the SH3 domain of more distantly related species, such as frog, may reflect increased evolutionary flexibility in this region while still preserving overall GRB2 function.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conservation patterns have important implications for cancer biology. GRB2 is frequently involved in oncogenic signaling downstream of hyperactive receptor tyrosine kinases, and mutations or alterations affecting highly conserved regions are more likely to disrupt normal signaling control. Variants occurring within conserved domains, particularly the SH2 domain, may therefore serve as useful biomarkers for identifying functionally impactful changes in GRB2-associated signaling. By establishing a baseline map of evolutionary constraint, this analysis provides a framework for prioritizing GRB2 variants that may contribute to cancer progression and could inform future studies investigating GRB2 as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of this study is that sequence conservation alone does not directly measure functional impact. While highly conserved regions are more likely to be functionally important, experimental validation or integration with functional datasets would be required to confirm the biological consequences of specific GRB2 variants in cancer contexts."
