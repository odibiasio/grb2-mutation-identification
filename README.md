# GRB2 Mutation Identification

This project explores sequence conservation in the GRB2 protein across vertebrate species to better understand which regions are evolutionarily constrained and therefore more likely to be functionally important. The goal is to establish a comparative baseline that can later be used to interpret cancer-associated GRB2 mutations.

## What’s in this repository
- `grb2_sequence_analysis.ipynb` — the main analysis notebook, including figures, step-by-step exploration, and interpretation
- `grb2_sequence_comparison.py` — a cleaned Python script containing the core functions used in the analysis
- `figures/` — output figures generated from the analysis
- `Grb2_Data/` — FASTA files containing GRB2 sequences from multiple vertebrate species

The notebook reflects the full exploratory workflow and reasoning process, while the Python script represents a streamlined version of the analysis logic for reuse and clarity.
